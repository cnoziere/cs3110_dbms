# cs3110_dbms

OCaml database management system (DBMS) that supports basic SQL queries.

# Core vision

We will create a Relational Database Management System. Key features include creating and dropping tables, inserting information, and retrieving information via queries. We will regularly backup the database to a JSON file to provide recoverability.


# Key features

- Support basic SQL queries: insert, drop, select, etc.
- Provide a REPL that permits interaction with the DBMS
- Create a new database from the REPL or by loading a JSON file
- Store the database as a JSON file that is updated throughout execution
